# Kruskal-s-algorithm-and-Dijkstra-s-algorithm
Generate random graphs based on edge density p and weight w. 
Create spanning trees using (1) Kruskal’s algorithm for MST and (2) Dijkstra’s algorithm for shortest path computations.
Compare the results of the two methods using (a) cost of edges, (b) average routing distance from a single source to all other destinations.
